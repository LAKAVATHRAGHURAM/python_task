Fibonacci Generator
The Fibonacci generator is a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

Functionality
The fibonacci_generator function takes an integer n as input and generates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms using the generator pattern. It yields each Fibonacci number one by one, starting from 0.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It begins with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

Usage
To use the fibonacci_generator function:

Call the function fibonacci_generator with the desired number of Fibonacci numbers you want to generate.
The function returns a generator object that can be converted into a list or iterated over to obtain the Fibonacci sequence.
python
Copy code
n = int(input("Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers you want to generate:"))
fibonacci_sequence = list(fibonacci_generator(n))
print(fibonacci_sequence)
Example
Suppose you want to generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers. You can use the fibonacci_generator function as follows:

python
Copy code
fibonacci_sequence = list(fibonacci_generator(10))
print(fibonacci_sequence)
This will output:

csharp
Copy code
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

Custom Voice Assistant
This is a custom voice assistant created using Python. It enables users to interact with their computer using voice commands.

Features
Speech Recognition: The voice assistant uses the SpeechRecognition library to recognize speech input from the user.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: It utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert text responses into speech output.
Basic Commands: The voice assistant responds to the following basic commands:
"hello": Greets the user and asks how it can help.
"what is your name": Introduces itself as the user's personal assistant.
"exit": Terminates the voice assistant.
Requirements
To use the voice assistant, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
SpeechRecognition library
pyttsx3 library
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
Usage
Run the Python script voice_assistant.py.
Upon execution, the voice assistant will greet you and wait for your command.
Speak one of the supported commands ("hello", "what is your name", "exit").
The voice assistant will respond accordingly.
